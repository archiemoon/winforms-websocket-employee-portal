Matrix Maker and Shift Manager ( Timesheet manager )



A database of all employees and phone numbers
A database of what contracted employees work on what days 
A database for each individual day which can allow people to be added and removed
A database which allows for users to submit timesheets 

Creates matrixes 
Has a data base of the contracted people on each shift 
At the start a database of each people contracted on each day will have to be made 
Creates a matrix for each day automatically 
This will then be loaded when a matrix is made for each day and they will be put onto the matrix 

Allows to remove people and will auto reassemble the matrix 
When a person is removed the matrix automatically reassembles itself 
If someone is removed the matrix will run the algorithm to remake the matrix giving priority to major 
Positions and will notify if a pool will have to be closed or numbers will have to be capped
Allowing the day to run smoothly

Can add people to the matrix 
Can add someone on the day and they will be slotted in and the matrix 
They can enter a name and a time into the database and this person will be added to the matrix 
readjusted around them 
Which will then readjust automatically 

Allows you to send out shift requests via text message 
A manager can sign in and send out a message requesting a shift to be 
A manager can select employees to send an automated message too asking if they are 
Available to work a shift 
picked up to all or select employees

Allows users to pick up shifts from the ones available 
Employees can see a spreadsheet of available shifts and pick up ones 
Employees will be able to see a list of available shifts for any given day and they can pick one up 
This will then notify the managers and will also add them to the data base for that day 
They will then be added to the matrix data base for that day and the manager will be 
Prompted to update the matrix
A new matrix will then be made when the manager next updates the matrix 

Pay Calculator 
Allows users to calculate their pay based on their pay and their hours which can be logged 
A simple mathematical algorithm to calculate estimated monthly pay 
Doesn’t store any data about pay on any database 
As they work or they can input a chunk at the end of the month
_________________________________________________________________________________________________

Allows managers to sign in and see what timesheets have been filled in for that day which they can check
Managers can sign in and see what timesheets need signing they can then check if they were on the matrix 
Employees can submit their timesheet at the end of their shift which will then be added to a data base 
These can be viewed by the manager and can be signed off which will notify the employee 
And sign off the timesheet accordingly
