Objectives

Create the algorithm to generate the daily rota.

•	The algorithm will generate the complete rota where lifeguards contracted shifts are loaded in from the database. 
•	Allow them to add more rows with a specified time for any on the day changes.
•	Their positions will be randomly selected from the list of allowed numbers. 
•	The algorithm will ensure that the rota doesn’t include duplicate positions where possible.
•	As well as ensuring that each lifeguard has a maximum of three positions in a row before an ‘off’.


Make a secure Login System (Coding Done)

•	Users will enter their username and password.
•	The password will then be hashed using my algorithm. 
•	The user will have 5 total incorrect attempts before they are locked out, to prevent brute force attacks.


Password Hashing (Coding Done)

•	The password will be hashed using my algorithm (View ‘Systems’ heading for more info).
•	To verify the password, it will be hashed and compared to the password stored in the database, if the two match the user can login.
•	The algorithm will also include a salt to ensure that there can be no duplication issues in the database.


Create a group messaging system using WebSockets that all users can use. (Coding Done)

•	Implement an indicator light indicating whether they are connected.
•	Can press button to attempt reconnect.
•	 Any error messages will also be displayed to the user.

•	Users that are logged in will be able to send real time messages to any other logged in user.
•	All sent messages will be stored in the database.
•	To reduce load times; I will only load the previous 10 messages, when a new user logs in, but allow the user to load another previous 10 messages when and as they need to.


Allow for Shift management where managers can upload, and lifeguards can pick up shifts

•	Managers will be able to create a post which contains the information about the shift such as the time and the location.
•	This will be stored in the database with a blank field for the name of someone who picks that shift up. 
•	Only shifts that haven’t been taken will be displayed meaning they can pick up any shift they see, and their name will be added to the database. 
•	I will also use this table of the database in the rota generator, so it automatically adds anyone that has picked up a shift for that day.


An Account management page where users can edit their details. (Coding Done)

•	Allows users to manage their profile such as passwords and usernames. 
•	In order to edit their password, they will be required to enter their current password.
•	Any changes they make will be updated in the database. 
•	All inputs will be checked to ensure they are in the correct format for the database.


A simple Home Page with ‘widgets’ that show key information to the user. 

•	The main page that will allow users to see small widgets of info which can be expanded into a full screen page of the widget. 
•	It will include widgets such as what shifts they have picked up, their previous pay slips, and more.


Allow for users with admin permissions to manipulate the database.

•	Users with admin permissions will be able to access a further range of tools to add and remove users as well as edit and update information.
•	They can also add new contracted shifts and view the database.
•	The permissions of users will be assigned at creation of the user.
